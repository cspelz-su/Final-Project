    "1. When you enter something other than `'everyday', 'select',` or  `'premium'` what happens? Modify the program to print `that is not a paint quality` and then exit in those cases.\n",
    "When you enter something other than the specificed choices, the program will still run and doesn't crash, but it lets you know you need to enter one of the specified choices.\n",
    "2. What happens when you enter something other than `'y'` or `'n'` for color matching? Re-write the program to print `you must enter y or n` whenever you enter something other than those two values.\n",
    "It still ran when you didn't enter yes or no, but it wouldn't give you a value until yes or no was entered.\n",
    "3. Why can't we use Python's `try...except` in this example?\n",
