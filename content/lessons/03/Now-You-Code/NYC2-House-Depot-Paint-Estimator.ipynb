    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",
    "- the height of the room in feet\n",

    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted ( sum of each of the 4 walls)\n",
    "- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "1. Why does the program still run when you enter a negative number for length? \n",
    "The program still runs when you enter a negative number for length because it is a float and floats can be negative numbers.\n",
    "2. Does the output make sense when you enter a negative length? Why type of error is this? \n",
    "There would be an input error because it is human error to enter a negative length. The output does not make sense because you cannot have a negative length even though the program accepts it. \n",
    "3. Why do we use `math.ceil()` in this program? In other words are you allowed to buy 3.75 gallons of paint?\n",
    "We use 'math.ceil()' because it will always round up the answer when there is a decimal for the answer. This is important with paint because if you rounded down, you wouldn't have enough paint to finish painting the room."
